This package has several sorting algorithms in python3.7.
To use (with caution), simply do::

    >>> import sorting_algorithms_v3
    >>> print sorting_algorithms_v3.bubbleSort()
    >>> print sorting_algorithms_v3.insertionSort()
    >>> print sorting_algorithms_v3.selectionSort()
    >>> print sorting_algorithms_v3.quick_sort()


ENJOY!
